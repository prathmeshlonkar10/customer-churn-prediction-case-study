# Customer Churn Prediction Case Study

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a B2B energy services setting. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and a powerful XGBoost model, the goal was to identify customers at risk of churn and develop actionable retention strategies based on the model's insights.

## üîç Key Steps & Methodology
### 1) üßº Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Merged customer metadata with detailed pricing history

- Identified missing values, outliers, and distribution skews

- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for visual exploration of churn vs. non-churn trends

### 2) ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering
- Converted and extracted date-based features: activation month, tenure, renewal time, etc.

- Generated derived metrics: `net_margin`, `forecast_cons`, `cons_12m`, etc.

- Encoded categorical features and normalized numerical ones for modeling

- Final feature set contained 30+ engineered features

### 3) ü§ñ Predictive Modeling
- Trained and optimized a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn

- Tuned hyperparameters such as `max_depth`,  and `n_estimators`

- Achieved ~90% test accuracy and strong precision-recall performance

- Identified top churn drivers:

### 4) üìà Visualization & Business Insights
- Created feature importance plots to interpret model decisions

- Analyzed churn probabilities by customer segment and profit tier

- Proposed a targeted discount strategy (20%) for high-value customers at risk of churn

## ‚úÖ Results & Impact
- Achieved 90% accuracy in predicting churn

- Built an explainable model with interpretable business features

- Enabled targeted interventions to retain high-margin clients

- Demonstrated a practical approach to data-driven retention strategy
